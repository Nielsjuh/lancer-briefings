The deployment went disastrous, a flash of light ripped the dropship from the sky causing a fatal crash for most of the people on board.
Delta squad, being strapped into their mechs, survived the crash with just a few bruises and quickly confirmed that most of the crew had died.

When they tried to establish where they had landed they quickly noticed that there was heavy jamming and that their long ranged sensor were being scrambled.
